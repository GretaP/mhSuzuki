            <h2>About the Suzuki Method</h2>
            <p>Founded in the 1950s by Shinichi Suzuki, the Suzuki Method grew out of his observations that children were universally successful at learning their mother tongue. He recognized that such learning was successful because the child was totally immersed in the sounds and rhythms of the language, because the child was expected to learn only in steps appropriate to their age level, and because loving and caring parents reinforced and encouraged the learning process.</p>
            <p>By applying these principles to musical instrument study, Suzuki developed a <u>method of teaching</u> that focuses
                on developing the whole child. With the active involvement of their parents, children are immersed in the music
                at home by listening to recordings of the repertoire to be learned. Children are motivated by the demonstrated
                interest and involvement of their parents, by seeing other students their age performing and having lessons,
                and by their individual experiences of success at learning, step by step, a creative and complex skill.
            </p>
            <p>Teachers are trained to create a learning environment at the lesson that enables a child to learn at their
                own natural pace and that fosters an attitude of self-esteem that is based on real accomplishment. The learning
                environment centers itself around the belief that to become a fine artist or musician, one must first become
                a fine person. Student, parent and teacher work together in a 'triangle' of communication, supporting each other
                in their endeavors.
            </p>

            <h4>Highlights of the Suzuki Method</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>fosters a concern for the whole child â€” physical, social, emotional and cognitive
                <li>emphasizes individual appropriateness while offering a challenging curriculum, allowing
                    children to operate on the edge of their developing capacities
                <li>is child centered, rather than teacher centered
                <li>takes "one step at a time": consolidates what the child knows and is able to do, and encourages
                    acquisition of new skills built on a strong foundation of positively experienced "success events"
                <li>tailors skills acquisition "steps" to match the individual learning pace of the child, thereby
                    guaranteeing the experience of successful learning
                <li>develops a positive sense of the child's own self identity, while fostering respect for others
                <li>creates an environment where children feel safe and valued
                <li>actively involves the parent in the learning process, establishing a reciprocal relationship
                    between teacher and parent
            </ul>
