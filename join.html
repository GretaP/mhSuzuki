            <p>To join our Support Team visit the ‘Support Us’ page.</p>

            <h3 id="HowToJoin">How to join as a Teacher</h3>
            <p>We prefer members to be Active Teacher members of the SAA with a publicly available profile in the SAA directory. In lieu of a public profile, we require an official SAA Course Completion Certificate with your request to join our Collaborative.</p>
            <p>All instruments are welcome. To list your instrument with our Collaborative you must have registered coursework with the Suzuki Association of the Americas (SAA) in the instrument you want to teach. If you are not yet a Suzuki teacher, the <a href="https://suzukiassociation.org/teachers/teacher-training/">SAA has information on how to become one.</a></p>

            <h3 id="WhoToContact">Who to contact and what info to send</h3>
            <p>Please send your email request with all pertinent details to Mid-Hudson Suzuki Music Collaborative at <a href="mailto:info@mhsuzuki.org">info@mhsuzuki.org</a>. Include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your name and contact information</li>
                <li>A link to your publicly accessible SAA listing OR a pdf of your official SAA Course Completion Certificate</li>
                <li>Please indicate exactly which Suzuki Method instrument(s) you teach and how you would like to be listed on our website.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Membership Fee for the Collaborative is being considered. Costs of Communal Events are shared. Recital events are covered by student participation fees; teacher support is through participatory presence to whatever extent is practical for the individual teacher.</p>

            <h3 id="WhyJoinUs">Why join us?</h3>
            <p>We are NOT a school - we are a group of teachers dedicated to the Suzuki Method who are working together to pool resources and to foster a sense of the ‘Suzuki Triangle’ within our local community. Our members teach in the Mid-Hudson River Valley and value the rich and nurturing ‘Suzuki environment’ that collaborating with other similarly minded teachers provides.</p>
            <p>Our regular communal events include twice annual (Fall and Spring) student recital events, with other Suzuki-related events possible as the opportunity arises. Our student recital events are designed to offer the student a quality performance experience as near to a ‘professional level environment’ as possible. That professional level goal includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The option of performing with an experienced professional-caliber piano accompanist, including a short rehearsal prior to concert-time</li>
                <li>A professional-level venue and piano</li>
                <li>A supportive audience and peer environment</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Collaborative organizes venue, accompanist, programming and administrative tasks while keeping student fees as low as feasibly possible. Member teachers are expected to support their own (and other teachers') students at our recital events and may be asked to assist in small tasks that may arise.</p>

            <h3 id="TryUsOut">Try us out</h3>
            <p>If you are a Suzuki teacher in the Mid-Hudson area and can prove registered training with the SAA, you are encouraged to sample our activities on a guest basis. For more details, contact <a href="mailto:info@mhsuzuki.org">info@mhsuzuki.org</a></p>
